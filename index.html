For example what you should see on the GitHub tab right now is "{GitHub Octocat Logo} ForeverPyrite.github.io/index.html." The icon "in this case my ForeverPyrite Logo or in GitHubs the Octocat logo" is called a favicon. You need a file called "favicon.ico" (.ico is an Icon file for HTML and also Windows Mouse and Application icons) in the root of your website for your icon to appear, otherwise the WorldWideWeb logo will apear instead   -->
